# Introduction

Hello, hello! My name is Ada, let's get acquainted \o/

I am a web developer, Linux engineer and system administrator. I host my own [social network](https://underground.pm) which based on [Misskey](https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey). I love to travel, make new acquaintances with interesting people, play chess.

Here I maintain my projects. In addition, I have a [microblog](https://underground.pm/@miraikumiko) in which I write about everything.
